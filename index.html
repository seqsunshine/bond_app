    <p>The Bond app is a friend database app. You can log in, add friends and create occasions with your added friends.
    In your user profile, you can add all of your preferences, either choosing from the default preferences, which are provided, 
    or you can create custom preferences to truly customize your page. In the My Friends page, you can select from your friends
    and view thier preferences as well. When creating an Occasion, you can select friends, and select default preferences for your
    occasion. When you view the Occasion Details page, you then can see all friends who were invited, along with each of thier
    preferences that you have selected to view, all in one place. This function makes it easy to plan dinners and outings with your
    friends.</p>
